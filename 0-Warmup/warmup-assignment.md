## Goals for the Class
I want to deepen my understanding of systems programming and how it relates to hardware and the operating system. I hope to strengthen my skills in the C programming language, especially with concepts like processes, threads, and memory management. By the end of the course, I aim to feel more confident in writing efficient and robust low-level programs.

## Concerns About the Class
My main concerns are managing the programming assignments within tight deadlines, as they seem complex and time-intensive. Additionally, mastering concurrent programming and network programming might be challenging without prior experience. Finally, ensuring my Linux environment is configured properly to avoid technical delays is also something I want to address early.
