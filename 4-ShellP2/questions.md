1. Can you think of why we use `fork/execvp` instead of just calling `execvp` directly? What value do you think the `fork` provides?

    > **Answer**: The fork/execvp pattern allows the shell to continue by creating a child process that can be replaced
	 > with a new program while the the paren shell process remains intact. Without fork() executing execvp() directly
	 > would replace the shell process entirely, terminating it. The two step process also enables important shell
	 > features like maintaining stat,handling background processes and recovering from command failures.


2. What happens if the fork() system call fails? How does your implementation handle this scenario?

    > **Answer**:  if fork() fails, it returns -1 and sets errno to indicate the specific error, typically due to
	 > resource exhaustion (e.g too many processes or insufficient memory).My implementation handles this by printing the
	 > error with perror("fork") and cleaning up command resources. The shell then continues its command loop rather than
	 > terminating, maintaining stability even under resource constraints.

3. How does execvp() find the command to execute? What system environment variable plays a role in this process?

    > **Answer**: Execvp() first checks if the command contains a slash (/) to try executing it as a direct path. If no
	 > slash is present , it searches each directory listed in the PATH environment variable in order until it finds and
	 > executable matching the command name. This differs from execv() which requires absolute aths and allows users to
	 > run commands like ls without specifying their full path.

4. What is the purpose of calling wait() in the parent process after forking? What would happen if we didnâ€™t call it?

    > **Answer**: wait() prevents zombie processes by properly cleaning up terminated child processes and their
	 > resources from the system. It also provides synchronization by blocking the parent until the child completes,
	 > which enables proper sequential cpmmand execution. Additionally wait() retrieves the childs exit status , allowing
	 > the shell to detect and handle command failures appropriately.

5. In the referenced demo code we used WEXITSTATUS(). What information does this provide, and why is it important?

    > **Answer**:  WEXITSTATUS() extracts the lower 8 bits fomr the status value returned by wait(),but should ontly be
	 > used when WIFEXITED() confirms notmal termination. The exit code (0-255) indicates command success or failure and
	 > can carry error information from failed execvp() calls. The status is crucial for shell features like error
	 > detection, conditional execution and implementing the return code builtin.

6. Describe how your implementation of build_cmd_buff() handles quoted arguments. Why is this necessary?

    > **Answer**: it uses a state machine to track quote context which preserves spaces and special characters within
	 > quotes strings while stripping the quotes themselves from the final arguments. Ir proprly handles both single and
	 > double quotes ensuring proper parsing of complex arguments like 'echo "hello world"'. This functionality is
	 > neccessary because commands often need to handle arguments containing spaces, such as file paths or multi word
	 > strings

7. What changes did you make to your parsing logic compared to the previous assignment? Were there any unexpected challenges in refactoring your old code?

    > **Answer**: I removed pipe handling completely and switched from a commmand_list_t structure to working with a
	 > single cmd_buff for simpler command processing. Challenges included mamnging memory without pipes, this required
	 > careful attention to cleanup and allocation. 

8. For this quesiton, you need to do some research on Linux signals. You can use [this google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=Linux+signals+overview+site%3Aman7.org+OR+site%3Alinux.die.net+OR+site%3Atldp.org&oq=Linux+signals+overview+site%3Aman7.org+OR+site%3Alinux.die.net+OR+site%3Atldp.org&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBBzc2MGowajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) to get started.

- What is the purpose of signals in a Linux system, and how do they differ from other forms of interprocess communication (IPC)?

    > **Answer**:  Signals are asynchronous, lightweight notifications (e.g interrupts) used for process control and
	 > system events inLinux. Unlike other IPC methods such as pipes or shared memory, signals dont carry data beyond
	 > their signal number and can be sent by both processes and rthe kernel. They provid a non queued mechanism for
	 > process  communicaiton making them ideal for simpe control operations but less suitable for data transfer. 

- Find and describe three commonly used signals (e.g., SIGKILL, SIGTERM, SIGINT). What are their typical use cases?

    > **Answer**:  SIGKILL(9): force terminates a process immediately and cannot be caught or ignored making it the last
	 > resort when SIGTERM fails
                   SIGTERM(15): Requests graceful termination allowinf processes to clean up before exiting and is the
						 default signal for the kill command. 
                   SIGINT(2): Triggered by Ctrl+C it can be caught or ignored and typically allows programs to terminate
						 gracefully with proper cleanup. 

- What happens when a process receives SIGSTOP? Can it be caught or ignored like SIGINT? Why or why not?

    > **Answer**:  SIGSTOP pauses a process indefinitely, suspending its execution until a SIGCONT signal is received
	 > and is commonly triggered by ctrl+Z in terminals. Unlike most siognals SIGSTOP can not be caught because it is a
	 > fundamental kernel-level process control mechanism needed for job control and debugging. This uncatchable nature
	 > ensures that systems always have a reliable way to suspend processes, which is essential for process management
	 > and debugging tools.
